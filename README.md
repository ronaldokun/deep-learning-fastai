# Study Repository for the Deep Learning Curriculum from fast.ai
After suffering from repeateadly just passively watching the lectures and just executing the notebooks, despite Jeremy warned to not do that, and not being able to really learn much. After all learning is dinamic.

This repository is my attempt to created copies from the courses notebooks, strip them from the given code and turn it to exercises to force me to rewrite the functions and classes. In the process I extend the explanations, define functions in a more verbose and piecewise manner.

I tried using the Classic Jupyter Notebook extensions: Exercise and Exercise2 to create the question and hidden solutions but unfortunately the format was not preserved between runs and sometimes even lost. So I kept only the stripped notebooks in the folders. The solutions can be seen in the courses notebooks.
